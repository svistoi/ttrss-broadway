Robert Virding discusses how the core Erlang team took a different path from the rest of the software world in the design and reason of the BEAM itself. Frank Hunleth describes the burgeoning world of IoT, problems that the BEAM is well suited to solve, and now Nerves makes those solutions a reality. Frank Savage takes us to the world of functional GUI, why http isn\u2019t appropriate to solve all problems and how Scenic uses the BEAM to explore solutions in this space.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https:\/\/codesync.global\/speaker\/frank-hunleth\/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - ROBERT VIRDING\nCo-creator of Erlang\n\nRobert Virding is Principal Language Expert at Erlang Solutions Ltd. While at Ericsson AB, Robert was one of the original members of the Ericsson Computer Science Lab, and co-inventor of the Erlang language. He took part in the original system design and contributed much of the original libraries, as well as to the current compiler. While at the lab he also did a lot of work on the implementation of logic and functional languages and on garbage collection. He has also worked as an entrepreneur and was one of the co-founders of one of the first Erlang startups (Bluetail). Robert also worked a number of years at the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) Modelling and Simulations Group. He co-authored the first book (Prentice-Hall) on Erlang, and is regularly invited to teach and present throughout the world.\n\nMore on Robert Virding: https:\/\/codesync.global\/speaker\/robert-virding\/\n\n\nTHE SPEAKER - FRANK HUNLETH\nNerves co-author\n\nFrank has built embedded Linux-based software for products in many industries including medical, consumer, telecommunications and defense.

When it comes to Tubi, where the system need to process thousands of hours each week, it became a quite big challenge.\nThe Tubi team has created a way of breaking a single video process job to hundreds of tasks and distributed different tasks to different nodes that live in the same cluster. The cluster is built on OTP, the resources (CPU and IO) used by each task on each node are properly managed. Each task is doing a tiny bit of the whole thing, the input of each task may come from the output the task, both tasks may be running in different nodes.\n\nSlides & full abstract: https:\/\/codesync.global\/speaker\/haofei-wang\/\n\n---\n\nTHE SPEAKER - HAOFEI WANG\nHaofei is a passionate software engineer who loves to build scalable distributed systems.
